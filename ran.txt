In the winter of 1895,in Holyoke, Massachusetts (United States), 
William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created 
a new game called Mintonette, a name derived from the game of 
badminton, as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by
any number of players.The game took some of its characteristics
 from other sports such as tennis and handball.
