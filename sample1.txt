Some additions in the new standard, such as auto for type inference, are pervasive.
These facilities make the code in this edition easier to read and to understand.
Programs (and programmers!) can ignore type details, which makes it easier to
concentrate on what the program is intended to do. Other new features, such as
smart pointers and move-enabled containers, let us write more sophisticated classes
without having to contend with the intricacies of resource management. As a result,
we can start to teach how to write your own classes much earlier in the book than we
did in the Fourth Edition. We—and you—no longer have to worry about many of the
details that stood in our way under the previous standard.
